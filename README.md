# Tic-Tac-Toe-HTML-CSS-JAVASCRIPT-Separate-Frontend-Backend

Here are three files:-
1. Tic tac toe index.html
2. Tic tac toe style.css
3. Tic tac toe.js

The html connects to the css file, combinedly make the UI for the "tic tac toe" app.
The layout has 9buttons divided into 3*3 form. You can see the code.

The javascript file I made seperately. It will ask game inputs from you from the console and display output in the console.
So this .js file I can say as a console game! Right?

Now your task is to join the console app & the frontend! Take the challenge!! 😃

Note: always play multiplayer. I have kept the computer input player function empty! If you can code that, best of luck!!!
